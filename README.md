## ðŸ“– Theoretical Part

### 1. Blockchain Basics

A **blockchain** is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology where data is stored in blocks that are linked together using cryptography. Each block contains a set of transactions, a timestamp, and a reference (hash) to the previous block, ensuring data immutability. Blockchain operates on a peer-to-peer network, removing the need for a central authority. It enables trust and transparency among participants and is resistant to tampering and fraud due to its cryptographic structure and consensus mechanisms.

#### ðŸ”— Real-life Use Cases:
1. **Supply Chain Management**: Track goods from origin to consumer with transparency, reducing fraud and ensuring quality.
2. **Digital Identity**: Store and verify identities securely, enabling self-sovereign identity systems that protect user privacy.
